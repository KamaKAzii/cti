  <h4>Buying travel insurance</h4>
  <p>
  Buying Travel Insurance directly can save you almost half of what you would pay if you purchased your policy from a Travel Agent. BUT: How easy is it to navigate the ins-and-outs of a travel insurance policy? How can you get the best deal & most appropriate travel insurance for your next trip?
  </p>

  <p>
  Not every traveller has the same needs: Consider the needs of your trip, would you be suited to Business Travel Insurance? Are you a frequent flyer? You may need an annual travel insurance policy. Does the policy cover sporting equipment such as golf clubs, surfboards or adventure activities?
